# PSBT MAINNET TEMPLATE — DO NOT COMMIT A REAL PSBT WITH SIGNATURES

This is a **placeholder/template** file for a PSBT you generate locally. It intentionally does NOT contain any real signature data or a real PSBT for mainnet.

If you would like to save your own PSBT here for convenience, DO NOT commit it to a public repository.

Template usage (local only):

1) Generate PSBT locally using your node/wallet (run on your machine):

   bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=<your_wallet> walletcreatefundedpsbt '[]' '{"<bc1q...wass>":5.0}' 0 '{"feeRate":0.0002}'

   # Save output PSBT locally (not committed):
   # echo "<psbt_base64>" > /tmp/send5btc.psbt

2) Sign and finalize locally (recommended offline/hardware signing):

   # sign with wallet
   bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=<your_wallet> walletprocesspsbt "$(cat /tmp/send5btc.psbt)"

   # finalize
   bitcoin-cli finalizepsbt "$(cat /tmp/psbt_signed.psbt)"

3) Broadcast only from your own machine (requires confirmation token printed by finalize step if using the broadcaster script):

   export MAINNET_BROADCAST_TOKEN=<TOKEN_FROM_finalize>
   ./scripts/psbt_broadcaster.py --network main --live --broadcast --confirm-token $MAINNET_BROADCAST_TOKEN --rawhex <rawhex>

WARNING:
- NEVER commit a fully-signed PSBT or raw tx that spends real funds into a public repo.
- Committing unsigned PSBTs is also a privacy risk (reveals UTXO structure); avoid committing any real PSBTs.

This file was added as a *secure placeholder* to document the process and to provide a safe location for your local, private workflow. The repository will NOT include any real PSBT or private keys.
